A copy of my my personal website from my retired GITHUB account. 

The HTML and CSS code and framework is just embarrasing, but my main focus at the time was just working and hacking the canvas.

Plan to rebuild properly and take advantage of full Azure Static Web Apps, Serverless Fuctions, WASM, SVELTE and GPU in soon.
