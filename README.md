A copy of my my old, personal website from my retired GITHUB account. 

The HTML and CSS code and framework is just embarrasing, but my main focus at the time was just working and hacking the canvas. I plan to rebuild the graphics functionality into a more modern, web platform experience.

May gut and reframe in Svelte, explore WASM graphics rendering, and set up a more scalable gallery of creative code sketches and explorations.
